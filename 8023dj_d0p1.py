    ### From the draft:
    # The encode process is illustrated in Figure 177–5. Starting from the first message bit, each pair of bits that 
    # will be modulated into a PAM4 symbol are first XORed, resulting 60 bits, m_xor<59:0>, from the 120 bits 
    # of message. A Hamming encoder (68,60) will be used to generate the 8 parity bits based on the 60 bits 
    # obtained in the previous step.
    # For k = 0:59
    # m_xor(k) = m(2k) + m(2k+1)
