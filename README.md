	<h2>BCH and Reed Solomon (RS) decoding</h2>
 The decoder for BCH and RS codes is from this [repository](https://github.com/Omer-Sella/reedSolomon "Reed Solomon and BCH decoding"). It also has an encoder (which is just polynomial division), which I used to check encoder definition in the 802.3 physical layer amendment.
